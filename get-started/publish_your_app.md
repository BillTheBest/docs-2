# Publish your app

You can publish your app to http://netbeast.co the same way you did for installing it to the Netbeast Dashboard.

First you must have an account:
http://netbeast.co/#!/signup <br>
... or log in with github
http://netbeast.co/#!/signup

After that you can upload it manually following the instructions written on the site. Else you can do it directly from the command line:
```
beast publish app.tar.gz
```


`[Update your app]` Before the final release of the Netbeast Marketplace, you should remove your app and upload it again.
