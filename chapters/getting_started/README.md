# Getting started

All you need to get started is [to fork and clone a local copy of the Netbeast repository](http://docs.netbeast.co/cloning_netbeast.md). After doing that, you may want to learn a bit more about the [Dashboard](http://docs.nebteast.co/the_dashboard.md) and the [Toolbelt](http://docs.netbeast.co/the_toolbelt.md).

When you're ready, you'll want to head to the first steps section to get going.
