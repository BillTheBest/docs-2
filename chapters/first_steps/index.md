# First steps

The **Dashboard** is the place from where you can manage applications installed on
your Netbeast. And any device running Dashboard can be found in the network as a
Netbeast.

# Installing an application
<a name="installing-an-application"></a>

An app stands for the most common known web app, it can be everything from a web page
to a complete HTML5 app with great UX.

To illustrate this we have created a fun app and made it available as a Netbeast app.

Go to your running dashboard `install -> with Git` and use the following repo:

https://github.com/jsdario/padjs

After installation go back again to `apps` and you will be able to try out your brand
new sampler pad! Just click onto its icon to launch it.

#Installing a plugin

Plugin is an app that allows you to control a piece of hardware, take a look [here](../devices_currently_supported/index.md) to see how many devices are already supported.

If you have one of those devices you can try to download its correspondant plugin.
If you don't have any we have prepared a virtual one you can use to test it out
alltogether!

Go back again to the dashboard. This time, choose "explore". There, all available apps and plugins are shown here.

Let's install a 'light' plugin. If you have smart bulbs from wemo, philips hue, lifx or any other kind, you can try to find it among the apps listed. Install it! Make sure your bulb is online and usable.

If you do not have any smart bulbs home you can test it with a virtual bulb. Look for **bulb-plugin** and click `install`

Now if you open **bulb-plugin** and the app we previously installed we can see how playing the pad changes the bulb color.

If you have real bulbs or a sound device online (as _sonos_) you will see how it reproduces the sound.

>But, things could go wrong.

In that case click the link "_number_ of devices installed" –watch the first gif on this doc page– and take a look on the map. Look for your devices to check they are up and running. :white_check_mark:
