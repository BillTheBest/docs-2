# First steps

The **Dashboard** is the place from where you can manage applications installed on
your Netbeast. And any device running Dashboard can be found in the network as a
Netbeast.

# Installing an application
<a name="installing-an-application"></a>

An app stands for the most common known web app, it can be everything from a web page
to a complete HTML5 app with great UX.

To illustrate this we have created a fun app and made it available as a Netbeast app.

Go to your running dashboard `install -> with Git` and use the following repo:

https://github.com/jsdario/padjs

After installation go back again to `apps` and you will be able to try out your brand
new sampler pad! Just click onto its icon to launch it.

# Installing a plugin

Plugin is an app that allows you to control a piece of hardware, take a look [here](/chapters/devices_currently_supported/index.md) to see how many devices are already supported.

If you have one of those devices you can try to download its correspondant plugin.
If you don't have any we have prepared a virtual one you can use to test it out
alltogether!

Go back again to install and, this time, choose "explore". There, all app are shown!
Look for **bulb-plugin** and click "install" _et voilà!_

You can use now your pad and see how your bulb changes its color.
