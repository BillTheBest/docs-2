# Netbeast plugins

A Netbeast plugin is a kind of "application" that allow you to control device from a concrete brand through the [Netbeast API](../api_reference.index.md).
It's the sauce behind Netbeast API engine. With a plugin you can register a resource
for others to use, like a new brand of smart bulbs to be controlled as another _light_ source.

If you want to control a device that itÂ´s yet not supported by Netbeast. You can **create a plugin
and make it available for all the community**.

Lets connect everything!
