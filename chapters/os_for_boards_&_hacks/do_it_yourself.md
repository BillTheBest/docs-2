##Installing Netbeast Dashboard on Other Boards

If you have other board that we currently don't support that can be fix now!

We are going to explain what are the minimum requesities that a board needs to run the Netbeast dashboard.

- Store Memory: The board must have at least 4 Gb store memory. This is because the Netbeast dashboard needs at least 1 GB and you also want to install applications and this means more memory requirement.

- RAM Memory: The board must have at least 1GB RAM memory to have a good accurancy.

- Support Nodejs: The core of Netbeast is based on Nodejs, so if you are able to install nodejs on your board, you can run the dashboard easyly.


If you achieve all the requeriment above, you only need to:

1. Install Nodejs & NPM

2. Clone the dashboard from github

	git clone https://github.com/netbeast/dashboard

3. Run the dashboard
