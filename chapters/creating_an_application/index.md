# Netbeast apps

A Netbeast application allows you to control how devices interact each other. With Netbeast, you don't have to take care about wich brand or technology devices are using, you only need to say what topic you want to control (lights, sound, sensors...) and the value you want to give them (color, power, track...) 

Forget about learning different ways to create IoT applications for your smart devices and start learning how to do this in a simple and unique way thanks to [Netbeast API](../api_reference/index.md)

Start creating applications on the **first IoT marketplace** and share them with everyone! :package:
