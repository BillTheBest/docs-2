#Third party development tools

Netbeast is trying to become compatible with all the third party development tools focused on IoT. Here you will find all we are compatible with. 

Feel free to contribute or suggest any other tool on the [forum](http://forum.netbeast.co)

## Node-Red

[Node-RED](http://nodered.org/) is a tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.

Netbeast has been uploaded as a flow for node-red. Look [here](http://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-netbeast)
