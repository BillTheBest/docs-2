# Virtual plugins

A plugin is a Netbeast app that people to control hardware that has not yet been
ported to the API or that has been invented by you, a maker.

If you don't have the Hardware or don't want to set up your device for testing, you can use virtual
plugins. They simulates the behaviour of real devices.

We have some virtual plugins to play around as:

* Microphone plugin.
  Use your laptop microphone to detect ambient volume. Find it [here](https://github.com/netbeast/volume-plugin)

* Bulb plugin.
    Simulate the behaviour of a real Bulb, you can change colors and power. Find it [here](https://github.com/netbeast/bulb-plugin)
