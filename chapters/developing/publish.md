# Publishing apps & plugins

To get your app/plugin onto Netbeast's Dashboard `Explore` section, create a Github repository. Make sure to include **Netbeast app** or **Netbeast plugin** both in the description and in the README file.

To find Netbeast apps we make use of GitHub's search API. We see the same results that appear (JSON formatted) when you make a `GET` request to:
> https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=netbeast+language:javascript

If your app is on the list it will soon be available on Netbeast.
