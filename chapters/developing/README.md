# Developing with Netbeast

Netbeast was made to empower software developers to create amazing applications and services for IoT. As a developer, you don't have to worry too much about the underlying technologies, network protocols and device specific APIs. Just focus on what's important: developing your app.

The Netbeast Toolbelt is a great help to bootstrap application and plugin development. That's where we will get started.
