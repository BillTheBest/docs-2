# Publish your app

You can publish your app to http://netbeast.co the same way you did for installing it to the Netbeast Dashboard.

First you must have an account:
http://netbeast.co/#!/signup <br>
... or log in with github
http://netbeast.co/#!/signup

### Publish from the command line

You can do that just by typing:

```
beast publish app.tar.gz
```

### Publish manually

### Update your app

Before the final release of the Netbeast Marketplace, you should remove your app and upload it again.

This is because the future upload and distribution mechanism will be based on git, rather than compressed packages. This will take long but the development experience will be much better.
