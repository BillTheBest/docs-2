# Publish your app

If you want your app displayed on Netbeast dashboard _Explore_ section you must create a repo in github with **Netbeast app** or **Netbeast plugin** both in description and `README.md`.

To find the apps we make use of GitHub search API. We see the same results that appear (JSON formatted) when you make a `GET` request to:
> https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=netbeast+language:javascript

You'll know that your app will be shown if it appears there!

We make the _Featured apps_ section out of apps that people give a _star_.

You can star our dashboard repo! :)
