# Write your first app

First we will install the netbeast SDK. Open a terminal and type:

```
npm install -g netbeast-cli
netbeast new myapp
```

A new folder named "myapp" will contain some code scaffolded.

Run:
```
cd myapp; node index.js --port 3000
```
To have it running on http://localhost:3000
